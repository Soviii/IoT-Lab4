## Overview of Lab 4
The goal of lab 4 is to have control over an LED via bluetooth and track the number of
steps counted from our accelometer and gyroscope sensor and display it on the nRF Connect mobile app as well. 
The way to do so is by creating a bluetooth instance with our TTGO and connecting to it via smartphone/mobile app. 
From there, the TTGO gathers the information from the sensor and uploads the data to the app while also retrieving UTF-8 messages
sent from the app as well. 

## Files Changed
The only file changed is the main.cpp in src.
